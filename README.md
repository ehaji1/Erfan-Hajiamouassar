My name is Erfan Hajiamouassar, a freshman studying Finance at Arizona State University. I am a peer advisor for the W.P. Carey school of business as well as a member of Arizona State University's TAMID consulting and fundraising chapter. I get to work on projects directly with Israeli FinTech startups. I enjoy creating music on my off time, specifically hip-hop and r&b.

My ultimate career goal is to find a consulting role in which I am able to provide meaningful change to the world while still having the ability to be a present father to a future family. 

I chose to specialize in FinTech because it merges my areas of interest. I am studying finance and understand that technology will only continue to push bounderies in the field.
